Make provider fallback selection deterministic.

Location: `src/market_dashboard/services/data_service.py`

Current behavior: When multiple providers are available, the iteration order
may vary (dict ordering, set operations).

Requirements:
1. Find any places where provider selection/iteration could be nondeterministic
2. Add explicit sorting (alphabetical by provider name)
3. Ensure fallback order is consistent across runs
4. Add a comment explaining the determinism guarantee
5. If using sets, convert to sorted lists

Acceptance: Provider fallback order is identical across runs, tests pass.
