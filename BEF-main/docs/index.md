# Capsules + STC Documentation Map

This repository’s docs are split into four layers. Read what you need, and only that:

- Primer (human intro): `docs/primer.md`
- Spec (normative; single source of truth): `docs/spec/`
- Security model (hostile‑review predicates): `docs/security_model.md` and `docs/security/theorems.md`
- Guides (integration and CLI): `docs/guides/`

CLI quickstart:
- CLI usage: `docs/guides/cli.md`
- Portable `.cap` format: `docs/spec/10_cap_format.md`

If you find any definition duplicated outside of `docs/spec/`, treat it as non‑normative. The spec is the law.

Backend guides:
- Geom: `docs/backends/geom.md`
- Risc0: `docs/backends/risc0.md`
